            1.  Make sure all organic matter is removed from hands. All visible organic matter (for example: dirt) must
            be removed from hands prior to applying waterless hand sanitizer.<br>
            2.  Apply a dime sized amount of waterless hand sanitizer to the palm of one hand or use a waterless hand
            sanitizer wipe.<br>
            3.  Rub hands together covering all surfaces of hands and fingers.<br>
            4.  Rub until waterless hand sanitizer is absorbed.<br>

                serious respiratory illnesses like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), whooping cough, and
                COVID-19.
                <br>
            <p class="maintag"> Germs can be easily spread by:</p>

            <ul>

                <li>Touching your face with unwashed hands after touching contaminated surfaces or objects.

            Covering coughs and sneezes and washing hands are especially important for infection control measures in

                <li>Throw used tissues in the trash.</li>
                <li>If you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands.</li>

            <p class="column-heading">USING A FACE-MASK AND GLOVES</p>
            <p class="column-content">

            <p class="maintag">How to put on a mask and gloves:</p>
            <br>
            1.  Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, if that’s not possible, apply hand
            sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. <br>
            2.  Make sure there are no holes or tears in your mask, bandana, or whatever fabric face covering you’re
            using. <br>
            3.  If you wear glasses, take them off. <br>
            4.  Determine which side of the face mask is the front. You should always wear your mask in the same
            orientation to avoid cross-contamination. <br>
            5.  If you’re using a mask with ear loops, bring the mask to nose level and place the loops around your
            ears. If you’re using a mask with ties, bring the mask to nose level and secure the top set of ties into
            a bow around the crown of your head. If you’re using a mask with elastic bands, hold the mask in one
            hand at nose level. Stretch the top strap over your head so that it rests over the crown of your head.
            Then pull the bottom strap over your head so that it rests below the ears at the nape of your neck. <br>
            6.  If your face mask has a moldable nose bridge, pinch the mask around your nose for a more secure fit.
            <br>
            7.  If you’re using a mask with ties, secure the bottom set into a bow at the nape of your neck. <br>
            8.  Pull the bottom of the mask over your mouth and chin and adjust the mask so that it’s snug, but not
            so tight that it’s painful or will move around. All straps should lay flat against your skin and not
            crisscross. Avoid having any large gaps — or hair, if possible — between your face and the mask. <br>
            9.  Put your glasses back on. <br>
            10.  If using gloves, pull them on and over the cuff of a long-sleeve shirt, if possible. <br>
            11.  Avoid touching the front of the mask — this includes resisting the urge to fiddle with the fit once
            it’s on your face. If you do, wash your hands or apply hand sanitizer again. Similarly, gloves should be
            changed or washed as often as you would normally wash your hands. Limit how many surfaces
            and items you touch to avoid cross-contamination. <br><br><br>

            <p class="maintag"> How to remove gloves and a mask:</p>

            <br>
            1.  Start with the gloves, if you’re wearing them. With a gloved hand, grasp the palm area of your other
            gloved hand just above the cuff and peel off the glove, turning it inside out. <br>
            2.  Holding the removed glove tightly in your gloved fist (do not let it hang down), slide the fingers of
            your ungloved hand under the remaining glove’s cuff and peel that glove off so that it’s also inside
            out. The first glove you removed should be inside the second. <br>
            3.  Place both gloves into a closed trash bin. (Disposable gloves are not meant to be reused, but if you
            absolutely must, you can wash them with soap and water, let them dry, then turn them inside out to use
            them once more. Just be sure there are no rips or tears.) <br>
            4.  Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, if that’s not possible, apply hand
            sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. <br>
            5.  If you’re wearing glasses, take them off. <br>
            6.  If you’re wearing a mask with ear loops, tilt your head forward, grasp the mask by the loops, and
            remove them from your ears. If you’re wearing a mask with ties or elastic bands, tilt your head forward
            and grasp the mask by the ties or bands, removing the bottom ones before the top. <br>
            7.  Machine wash and dry the mask, if possible, or hand wash the mask with soap and water and leave it in
            the sun to dry. <br>
            8.  Repeat step four. <br>
            9.  Put your glasses back on.<br>

            <p class="maintag">How contact tracing helps:</p>

            To stop any further spread of COVID-19, we need to trace the contacts of anyone who may have been exposed
            to COVID-19. Recording people’s movements helps us to do this quickly and efficiently. <br>

            The faster we can trace contacts, the faster we can prevent another outbreak of the disease. <br><br>

            <p class="maintag"> You can keep track of your movements by: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>keeping a list in a safe place.</li>
                <li>keeping a diary.</li>
                <li>using an app to record your movement.</li>
                <li>taking time-stamped photos of where you've been.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <p class="maintag">Everyone should continue to keep track of the 3 Ws:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Where you went.</li>
                <li>When you went there.</li>
